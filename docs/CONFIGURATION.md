# Akita-Zmodem-MeshCore Configuration

The Akita-Zmodem-MeshCore utility uses a JSON configuration file, typically named `akita_zmodem_meshcore_config.json`, to manage its settings. This file is automatically generated with default values in the same directory as the script if it doesn't exist when the script is first run.

You can also override several MeshCore connection parameters using command-line arguments.

## Configuration File (`akita_zmodem_meshcore_config.json`)

Here's an explanation of each field in the configuration file:

* `"zmodem_app_port": 2001`  
    * **Description**: An application-level port number. Since the underlying MeshCore messaging (as handled by `meshcore_py`) might not have a built-in port concept for multiplexing different applications on the same node, this utility prepends this port number to its data packets. The receiving end uses this to identify Zmodem traffic intended for this application.  
    * **Type**: Integer  
    * **Default**: `2001`

* `"chunk_size": 256`  
    * **Description**: This field is related to how the Zmodem protocol itself might internally buffer or handle data. The actual chunks sent over the mesh are governed by `mesh_packet_chunk_size`. This might be used by the Zmodem library if it has such a setting, but its direct effect depends on the specific Zmodem library implementation.  
    * **Type**: Integer  
    * **Default**: `256`

* `"mesh_packet_chunk_size": 128`  
    * **Description**: The maximum size (in bytes) of the payload for a single packet sent over the MeshCore network. This is after the `zmodem_app_port` has been prepended. Zmodem protocol packets can be larger than what the underlying mesh radio can handle in one go. This setting defines how the utility should break down larger Zmodem protocol data units into smaller chunks suitable for the mesh.  
    * **Type**: Integer  
    * **Default**: `128` (Adjust based on your MeshCore device's effective MTU and network conditions to avoid fragmentation by lower layers or packet loss).

* `"timeout": 60`  
    * **Description**: The duration (in seconds) of inactivity after which an ongoing transfer is considered timed-out and subsequently canceled. Activity is defined as successfully sending or receiving data chunks relevant to the Zmodem transfer.  
    * **Type**: Integer  
    * **Default**: `60`

* `"mesh_connection_type": "serial"`  
    * **Description**: Specifies the method used to connect to the local MeshCore device/interface that the `meshcore_py` library will use.  
    * **Values**: `"serial"` or `"tcp"`  
    * **Default**: `"serial"`

* `"mesh_serial_port": "/dev/ttyUSB0"`  
    * **Description**: If `mesh_connection_type` is `"serial"`, this is the serial port device name (e.g., `/dev/ttyUSB0` on Linux, `COM3` on Windows) where the MeshCore radio is connected.  
    * **Type**: String  
    * **Default**: `"/dev/ttyUSB0"`

* `"mesh_serial_baud": 115200`  
    * **Description**: If `mesh_connection_type` is `"serial"`, this is the baud rate for the serial communication with the MeshCore device.  
    * **Type**: Integer  
    * **Default**: `115200`

* `"mesh_tcp_host": "127.0.0.1"`  
    * **Description**: If `mesh_connection_type` is `"tcp"`, this is the hostname or IP address of the MeshCore device/interface that accepts TCP connections. This could be a local IP if the MeshCore device is connected to the host machine and exposed via a TCP serial bridge, or if `meshcore_py` connects to a TCP endpoint of a MeshCore daemon/gateway.  
    * **Type**: String  
    * **Default**: `"127.0.0.1"`

* `"mesh_tcp_port": 4403`  
    * **Description**: If `mesh_connection_type` is `"tcp"`, this is the TCP port number for the MeshCore connection. (Note: 4403 is commonly associated with Meshtastic; ensure this is the correct port for your MeshCore TCP service).  
    * **Type**: Integer  
    * **Default**: `4403`

## Command-Line Overrides for Connection Parameters

You can override the MeshCore connection settings from the configuration file using the following command-line arguments when running `akita_zmodem_meshcore.py`:

* `--mesh-type [serial|tcp]`: Overrides `mesh_connection_type`.
* `--serial-port <PORT_PATH>`: Overrides `mesh_serial_port`.
* `--serial-baud <BAUDRATE>`: Overrides `mesh_serial_baud`.
* `--tcp-host <HOST_IP_OR_NAME>`: Overrides `mesh_tcp_host`.
* `--tcp-port <PORT_NUMBER>`: Overrides `mesh_tcp_port`.

**Example:**

If your config file specifies serial connection, but you want to use TCP for one run:

```bash
python akita_zmodem_meshcore.py --mesh-type tcp --tcp-host 192.168.1.50 --tcp-port 6500 send "!NodeAlpha" /myfiles/data.bin
```

This command will attempt to connect via TCP to 192.168.1.50 on port 6500, overriding any serial settings in `akita_zmodem_meshcore_config.json` for this specific execution.
